# sierra-wrapper

A basic node wrapper for the [III Sierra v3 API](https://sandbox.iii.com/docs/Content/titlePage.htm)

The wrapper currently supports:

- Authorizing
- Returning a single, multiple and range Bib records
- Returning a single, multiple and range Item records
- Returning item records belonging to a single Bib record

In addition there are general methods that can be used to make any GET or POST
request:

- get
- post

More endpoint will be added as the need arises.

To configure credentials there are three options:

1. Store credentials in a json file in the format:

```
{
	"key": "YOURKEY",
	"secret": "YOURSECRET",
	"base": "https://your.domain.name.org/iii/sierra-api/v3/"
}
```
You then authorize and request by

```
const wrapper = require('@nypl/sierra-wrapper')

wrapper.config('./path/to/config.json')
```

2. You can pass in an options object with the same format as the json above, and pass it in to the same function

```
wrapper.config(options)
```

3. You can also set your credentials via environment variables: `SIERRA_KEY`, `SIERRA_SECRET`, `SIERRA_BASE`
